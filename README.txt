Very basic access to the postmark API. At the moment it just allows you to 
send a single message at a time. See example/example.go for a basic example.

TODO: 
    * Add batch support. Use channel interface and trigger when 
      enough messages are queued or a timer expires or both.
    * Look at the bounce API.
